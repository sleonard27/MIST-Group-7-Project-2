## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is titled "MTA Daily Ridership", sourced from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). It includes estimated average daily ridership data for various transit services across New York City from the years 2020 to 2025. Time Frame: 2020–2025, Daily ridership data, Breakdown by Service Type: Subways, Buses, Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), Metro-North Railroad, Staten Island Railway

Fields include (for every mode of transporation):

Total Estimated Ridership

% of Comparable Pre-COVID Ridership

Date (with weekday identification)

This dataset helps illustrate how public transit usage has evolved over time, particularly in response to major events like the COVID-19 pandemic, and offers insights into commuting patterns in one of the world’s busiest transit systems.



## Questions:

1. How has total ridership and usage of various modes of transit changed since the pandemic in 2020?

2. How do the average number of records for different modes of transportation vary throughout the week from Sunday to Saturday as well as their weekly totals?


## Manipulations:

1. Columns: Date in Years

   Rows: Measure Values (Sum of Ridership of Buses, Bridges & Tunnels, Subways, LIRR, Staten Island RR,

   Access-A-Ride, Metro-North Train)

   Filters: Date in Years (2020-2024)

   Color: Measure Names

   Detail: Measure Names

3. Columns: Weekdays

   Rows: Measure Values (Averages Ridership for Buses, Bridges & Tunnels, Access-A-Ride, Subways, LIRR,

   Staten Island RR, Metro-North Train)

   Color: Measure Names

   Label: Measure Names, Measure Values (Sum of Average Ridership per week)
