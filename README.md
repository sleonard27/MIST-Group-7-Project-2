## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is titled "MTA Daily Ridership", sourced from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). It includes estimated average daily ridership data for various transit services across New York City from the years 2020 to 2025. Time Frame: 2020–2025, Daily ridership data, Breakdown by Service Type: Subways, Buses, Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), Metro-North Railroad, Staten Island Railway

Fields include (for every mode of transporation):

Total Estimated Ridership

% of Comparable Pre-COVID Ridership

Date (with weekday identification)

15 Columns and 1776 Rows

This dataset helps illustrate how public transit usage has evolved over time, particularly in response to major events like the COVID-19 pandemic, and offers insights into commuting patterns in one of the world’s busiest transit systems.



## Questions:

1. How has total ridership and usage of various modes of transit changed since the pandemic in 2020?

Understanding shifts in ridership since 2020 reveals how public behavior and confidence in shared transportation have evolved post-COVID. These trends impact economic planning,
fare revenue, and decisions on service adjustments or infrastructure investment. They also reflect broader societal changes like remote work, urban migration, and environmental
concerns. The dataset provides daily ridership counts for five major transit services from 2020 to 2025. 

2. How do the average number of records for different modes of transportation vary throughout the week from Sunday to Saturday as well as their weekly totals?

Analyzing weekday versus weekend ridership helps transit authorities optimize scheduling and allocate resources efficiently. It highlights commuter patterns, such as the
dominance of work-related travel on weekdays or recreational travel on weekends. These insights can support better planning, reduce waste, and improve rider experience. The
dataset includes daily entries with the day of the week identified, making it ideal for grouping and comparing ridership by day. Each record includes ridership figures for all
transit types, allowing for both daily average and weekly total analysis.

## Manipulations:

The main manipulations that we did were changing the date into groups of years or looking at weekdays for the second question. We also manipulated the data by looking for the sum and averages for ridership for specific periods of time. We used Tableau's Data Filter and Values Calculations features to do these manipulations. These steps were essential to simplify the dataset and provide meaningful insights for both of our research questions.

## Analysis:

Graph 1

Subway ridership has increased dramatically since the pandemic. Its increase is also significantly more than the other modes, showing that as fear of COVID has decreased, more people are willing to ride subways. There was more Bridge & Tunnel usage than Buses in 2020. This is likely due to that fact that more people chose individual cars over public buses during the pandemic to avoid health risk. In the following years, Buses overtook Bridges & and Tunnels meaning than more people no longer feared the risk of COVID. Long Island RR, and Metro-North RR ridership has steadily increased since COVID while the Staten Island RR has remained the same throughout the years. Overall, all modes of transit have increased in ridership since 2020. This makes sense because people have steadily become more and more comfortable with public transportation since the end of the pandemic.
This could be useful in estimating demand and scheduling trains and traffic. 


Graph 2

Subways dominate ridership volume across all days, peaking midweek (around Wednesday/Thursday) with an average of 270,000 riders. Buses are the second most-used service, with peak usage also landing in the middle of the week, nearing 135,000 riders. LIRR and Metro-North follow similar curves, consistent usage patterns by commuters, while Staten Island Railway sees minimal traffic overall. There’s a noticeable dip during weekends (Days 1 & 7) across all systems, which suggests NYC has a heavily workweek-dependent transit flow. This could be helpful in optimizing train schedules and understanding where to devote more money within their transportation modes.
